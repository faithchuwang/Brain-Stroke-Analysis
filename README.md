### Project Overview

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization of a Brain Stroke dataset, focusing on identifying key risk factors and trends. The dataset includes demographic, medical history, and lifestyle attributes to understand stroke occurrence patterns.

### Data Sources

The dataset used in this project was obtained from Kaggle.

### Tools

- Excel – Initial data exploration
- SQL – Data extraction and preprocessing
- Python – Data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling
- Power BI – Interactive dashboard for insights


### Data Cleaning/Preparation

1. Handled missing values (bmi, smoking_status)
2. Converted age to integer
3. Standardized categorical values (Yes/No to 1/0)
4. Removed duplicate rows
5. Identified and handled outliers (avg_glucose_level, bmi)
6. Created age_group feature
7. Encoded categorical variables (work_type, smoking_status)
8. Verified dataset shape and consistency before analysis

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring patient data to uncover insights and answer key questions, such as:

- What age group is most affected by stroke?
- How do hypertension and heart disease impact stroke risk?
- Is there a correlation between BMI, glucose levels, and stroke occurrence?
- Does smoking increase the likelihood of having a stroke?
- Which work type has the highest stroke prevalence?

### Data Analysis

Include some interesting code/features worked with

### Results/Findings

1. **Age Factor**: Stroke prevalence increases significantly with age, especially in individuals above 60 years.
2. **Hypertension & Heart Disease**: Patients with hypertension or heart disease have a higher likelihood of stroke.
3. **BMI & Glucose Levels**: Higher BMI and glucose levels show a correlation with stroke occurrence.
4. **Smoking Impact**: Smokers, especially former smokers, have a higher stroke risk than non-smokers.
5. **Work Type Influence**: Certain work types, such as self-employed and government jobs, have a higher stroke prevalence compared to private-sector workers.
